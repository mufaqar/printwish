          <strong>TERMS OF AGREEMENT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use our website to get quotes or process an order with us,
          these Terms and Conditions of Business constitute the legally binding
          agreement between us. You are responsible to carefully read and review
          these Terms and Conditions of Business before using this website and
          before processing an order or quotation with us. Your use of our
          website is subject to your understanding and acceptance of our Privacy
          Policy and Terms and Conditions of Business. Use of our website or
          acceptance of a quotation will be considered acceptance of our
          policies. If you do not agree to the Terms and Conditions of Business
          below, you should not use our services. We have the right to modify
          our Terms and Conditions of Business, so please review them
          periodically. Please contact us if you have any doubts at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>PRICING:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          All prices on our website are quoted in pounds sterling (£). Prices
          may be subject to change without notice, but we will always inform you
          of any price change prior to processing your order. Any pricing
          structures seen on our website may differ if your order requires
          express delivery or is bespoke in any way. This is because stock of
          delivery issues may cause an increase in price and because sometimes
          our suppliers change prices without warning, and we are not able to
          update prices instantaneously. You will be fully informed of your
          price or change in before your order is confirmed. This may be after
          payment. We have the rights to cancel any order at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          All delivery is charged to a UK address or an estimated international
          delivery charge. If you have requested delivery outside of the UK, or
          if your postcode is outside standard delivery zones, please note that
          you may have to pay extra delivery at a later stage when we know the
          total cost of the order. This extra charge may be added after your
          initial payment, due to change in weight of delivery for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          If after payment, a pricing error or anomaly is made apparent we
          maintain the right to cancel any order. If this situation occurs the
          customer will be contacted by a member of our team and informed of the
          mistake in writing, and we will assess all options to give you the
          best service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>PAYMENT TERMS:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We accept all major credit and debit cards. We also accept payment by
          Cheque &amp; Bank Transfers. Orders will not be processed until
          payment has cleared.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ORDERS:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your payment has been received, we will send you a visual proof
          for you to check carefully and approve before we customise. Once your
          visual proof has been approved, we start processing the order
          immediately and although we try and accommodate further changes or
          cancellations, we can’t guarantee that we will complete them and you
          may be liable for the full order price. The visual proof is the final
          process in your order and contains all the detailed customisation and
          garment details, it is vital that you review this properly. After
          confirmation changes may not be possible, and any mistakes will be
          your responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ONLINE ORDERING – SIZES, COLOURS AND TEMPLATES:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note, we order blank clothing, garments and products from
          wholesaler distributors, and then customise these items with printing
          for our clients. All sizes and colours shown online on the catalogues
          are not under our control, and we cannot be held accountable for
          colour variations from on screen colours to real product colours, nor
          can we be held responsible for sizing issues. We do our very best with
          our Quality Controls to manage these rare problems. We highly
          recommend ordering samples to ensure these size and colour problems
          are not encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>PRODUCT TEMPLATE IMAGE DISCLAIMER:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note, the visual product template images that are used when
          adding your designs are ‘template images’, this means they may not
          reflect the actual product ordered. The same applies to your visual
          mock ups.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>VISUAL LAYOUT APPROVAL:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is much better if you send us a visual template to ensure speed of
          service and accuracy. We will send it to you if you can’t create it,
          and you are entitled to 2 revisions / changes free of charge with your
          visual. Further changes may be charged up to £5 per revision. Once you
          have approved the visual layout your decision is final. Extra charges
          may be applied should you wish to make further changes to approved
          visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellations are not accepted after this stage, but we will always
          try to assist you for the best possible service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not proceed until you have approved the visual(s), which will
          usually be sent within 24 hours of payment. (working business hours)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ARTWORK DISCLAIMER:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We will print the artwork you supply us. When uploaded or emailing
            us any artwork you give Print Wish Ltd, full consent to print the
            artwork or designs. You confirm that the artwork is yours to use,
            and/or free from copyright infringement. You accept full
            responsibility in the event of any copyright infringement. When
            emailing us or uploading artwork and upon payment you accept this
            artwork disclaimer in full.
          </li>
          <li>
            The visual template and online visual designer are not to scale. The
            size of the actual printed artworks may vary to the representation
            and proportions which you see online.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will always aim to print your exact print sizes but you accept
            there may be up to a 2cm variance on print sizes and positioning.
          </li>
          <li>
            COLOUR MATCHING: With Screen Printing we can match Pantone Colour
            References, if you provide this, we will match them. All other
            printing techniques will be the best colour match possible. Please
            note computer screen colours will differ from final print colours.
            We will not be held responsible for colour variation.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must state Pantone colour references with your quote requests or
            via email, if they apply. Failure to do so will mean we will use our
            expertise to best match on colours.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the artworks files you provide are not print ready, we will try
            to recreate the artworks and there will be a charge which we will
            let you know once we see your design. Artwork files that are not as
            per our artwork guidelines may still be printed, but the quality of
            the print may be lower than we would like, and Print Wish Ltd will
            not be responsible, and your order will not qualify for a reprint or
            refund.
          </li>
          <li>
            You accept full responsibility and confirm you have either provided
            print ready files, discussed this with us prior to payment, or are
            happy to pay a small charge, and confirm that we will not be held
            responsible for sub-quality print finishes that are caused as a
            result of sub-quality and non-print ready artwork files. If you have
            any doubt, please get in touch and we will check.
          </li>
          <li>
            For online sales, all artworks/files uploaded will be printed
            without artwork checking, and any quality issue will not be the
            responsibility of us. You will not be entitled to a refund or
            reprint if the artwork you provided us does not meet our minimum
            artwork guidelines requirements.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>
            DIRECT TO GARMENT PRINTING – VARIANCE AND WHITE UNDERLAY CONDITION:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          DTG printing is dependent on ‘computer-controlled output’. Artwork
          files are checked by our print managers for quality purposes, but
          ultimately a computer machine reads these colours and translates these
          colours into ink that gets printed directly into the fabric. (Screen
          printing can match exact Pantone colours and is controlled by the
          human eye, as such is ‘human controlled’ not computer controlled).
        </p>
        <p>
          DTG output is, therefore, subject to variance. This means when
          printing the same design several times it may not appear as sharp on
          one garment as another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, it may appear different on one garment to another
          garment due to colours and materials reacting different to the inks.
          Sometimes, small speckles of white underlay can be seen on dark
          garments, this is most often due to sub-quality artwork which we do
          our best to avoid. You accept the above information and accept a 25%
          variance and white underlay condition, and that any issues of this
          nature fall outside of our reprint and refund policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CANCELLATIONS:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellations may be subject up to a 25% charge because we may have
          already ordered stock, prepared artwork or re-organised production of
          other jobs. Please note that we reserve the rights to a minimum charge
          of up to 25%. For online orders where the order relates to a specific
          printing colour or product colour, if you fail to read the offer and
          upload incorrect artwork, this is your mistake and you may be charged
          up to 25% of the order if you choose to cancel due to a mistake you
          make when uploading artwork files. When paying for any order, you
          accept these terms and conditions in full. (We will always do our best
          to minimise or avoid such charges).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            PRINT ONLY SERVICE – WHERE YOU SUPPLY US WITH THE GARMENTS:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We take complaints very seriously and we are unhappy if you are not
          entirely satisfied with our services. If you wish to make a complaint
          or request a reprint or refund, please complete the contact us form
          immediately and provide us with your order reference number, email
          address and the reason for your complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must also attach photos to help us further understand your
          complaint so we’re then able to take the necessary actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Print Wish Ltd must be notified of any issues within 2 days of
          receiving the order. Please note that refunds will only be considered
          after Print Wish Ltd has been given every opportunity to rectify any
          issues with the order. We initially aim to offer a reprint or
          replacement if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>PAYMENT TERMS:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer a print only service whereby you can purchase the garments
          separately and then send them to us to be customised. When you use
          this service from us you understand that you’re sending the garments
          to us at your own risk. If they are lost in transit, we will not be
          held responsible. You must track the delivery and handle any issues
          that arise in delivery. In addition, we recommend test prints to
          ensure that the products are suitable for the printing technique that
          you require. We keep a keen eye on our quality control process, but,
          if you are supplying the products and there are problems with the
          print or damage to the garments due to the printing, that are not
          related to the print quality, we will not be held responsible for any
          of the cost of the garments / products. If you do not take our advice
          and send samples for testing, this is your complete responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can’t guarantee 100% perfection on goods you supply. You accept up
          to a 25% spoilage rate where we will not be responsible for the cost
          of damage caused due to printing or the customisation process. Before
          any print only order is processed you must include the original
          receipts/invoices of purchase showing the exact value or each product.
          We will then agree how much risk we are prepared to accept. If you
          fail to send us these receipts/invoices of purchase before the order
          is processed, we will not take any financial responsibility in the
          damage or loss to any of your products. If you do, we will agree in
          writing our limit of liability that you will accept in writing before
          printing commences.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find out the pros and cons of using our print only service, you can
          read our print only guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>IN ADDITION, WITH PRINT ONLY ORDERS:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are supplying the goods for customisation, the stated
          deadline is our target deadline, we cannot guarantee this until we
          receive the goods for inspection. In addition, although at quoting
          stage we assume we can complete the customisation, sometimes factors
          unknown to us at quoting stage can complicate an order and mean we may
          have to cancel and refund. We will always do our best to meet your
          deadlines and complete your orders to our best ability, but in the
          case of print only orders, you understand that the order may be
          cancelled upon receipt of the goods and that the deadline will be
          confirmed when we physically receive the goods for the specific order.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>EXPRESS ORDERS:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          For express order where delivery is required within 5 days you must be
          aware of the following information. We will do our best to meet our
          client’s deadlines, but sometimes, on rare occasions, factors beyond
          our control impact on our ability to fulfil orders. Stock levels,
          wholesaler dispatch mistakes and delivery problems can arise, which
          are factors beyond our controls. In the event of such occasions,
          sometimes we have to make decisions on behalf of our clients to ensure
          that we’re always doing our best to fulfil the order. This can mean
          substitution of garment brands and size changes or enhanced delivery
          services where extra charges may be applied. We will always try to
          find the time to get approval from our clients for these changes, but
          as you will be aware, this is not always possible. When entering an
          express order, you must accept these conditions and take this in to
          consideration in the event of ultimate problems with orders. We ask
          that you appreciate the effort we will go to meeting your order when
          discussing remedy of such rarely occurring scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            DELIVERIES DURING BUSY PERIODS OF ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          At periods of seasonal high demand, or during adverse weather
          conditions, delivery deadlines may be missed or delayed. We will
          organise and ship your goods in accordance with your delivery
          deadline. The items will be despatched using a 3rd party courier and
          we will be able to provide documentary evidence for this. If the
          delivery is not achieved for whatever 3rd party reason, Print Wish Ltd
          will not be responsible for refund of any form. We will attempt to
          recover costs and expenses from our 3rd party delivery companies but
          cannot guarantee any delivery or refund in these instances. Print Wish
          Ltd will not be liable for any loss or expenses sustained arising from
          any delay or failure in the delivery of the Goods. We recommend you
          take out your own insurance to protect your goods.

        </p>
        <p>
          Print Wish Ltd will send out your order using a 3rd party courier
          company in accordance with your delivery deadline and will be able to
          provide documentary evidence for this. If the delivery is not achieved
          for whatever 3rd party reason, Print Wish Ltd will take no
          responsibility for loss or damage or delay to your order and Print
          Wish Ltd will not be responsible for refund of any form. We will
          attempt to recover costs and expenses from the 3rd party delivery
          companies but cannot guarantee any delivery or refund in these
          instances. At time of receipt, you must check the packaging
          immediately. By accepting delivery, you are confirming the packaging
          and delivery is in perfect order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Print Wish Ltd will not be liable for any loss or expenses sustained

            PARTIAL DELIVERIES &amp; ERRORS ON THE PART OF OUR 3RD PARTY
            SUPPLIERS
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          At Print Wish Ltd we order blank products from leading brands and then
          customise them for our client’s needs. Sometimes the leading brands
          and distributors send us faulty products within the full batch, or do
          not send us the correct amounts or sizes, which is completely out of
          the control of Print Wish Ltd , but this means that production and
          delivery may be delayed, or an order may not be only partially
          delivered on the specified due date, as more products may need
          ordering and customising at a later date. There may be extra charges
          applied to your order for the additional printing as we may have to
          reset all the customisation machines specifically for the extra
          customisation. You understand this supply chain problem and accept
          that it is beyond the controls of Garment Printing and accept these
          terms.

          <strong>PRINT ONLY SERVICE AGREEMENT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Print Wish Ltd offers a print only service where our clients can
          supply the garments/products (the items) and send them to us to be
          customised. When using this service, you accept that you’re sending
          the items to us at your own risk. If they are lost in transit, we will
          not be held responsible. You must track the delivery and handle any
          issues that arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          We highly recommend sample prints to ensure that the items are
          suitable for the printing technique that you require. We keep an eye
          on our quality control process, but, if you are supplying the items
          and there are problems with the print, or damage during the
          customisation process, we will not be held responsible for any of the
          cost of the items, unless they have undergone a full sample test
          process and have been approved and signed off as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will do our best to detect any problems as soon as they arise and
          will aim to minimise the impact on any batch of the items, but some of
          our machines operate at fast automated speeds and therefore sometimes
          these issues do not make themselves apparent until the entire
          customisation process is completed. Also, our customisation processes
          involve multiple stages, and it may not be until the final stage that
          the problem is detected. For example, we may prepare the items, we may
          pre-treat them, then print them, and during the drying stage an issue
          may arise that could have already affected a full batch. If you do not
          take our advice and send samples for testing and approval, you take
          complete responsibility for any problems that may arise during the
          customisation process. Samples and Test prints are charged at
          pre-agreed rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before any print only order is processed, we request the original
          receipts/invoices of purchase/manufacture to be sent to us, outlining
          the exact value of the items. We will then agree how much risk and
          liability we are prepared to accept in advance. (if any). If you fail
          to send us these receipts/invoices of purchase before the order is
          processed, we will not take any financial responsibility in the damage
          or loss to any of the items.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Print Wish Ltd we offer a full reprint or refund policy on
          garments/products that we supply, if the problem is our
          responsibility. But when you are sending us your garments/products, we
          cannot guarantee 100% perfection and therefore print only services are
          not accepted under our standard Refunds Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, even after samples and testing there are problems, you still
          accept up to a 25% spoilage rate caused due to the customisation
          process. You also accept up to a 2cm variance in the print position.
          During customisation processes, items are manually loaded by our
          carefully trained and experienced staff, and 100% accuracy is simply
          not possible. Our years of experience and global clients can testify
          to the quality we offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            PRINT ONLY DELIVERY DEADLINES &amp; CANCELLATION POLICY
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are supplying the items for customisation, the stated
          deadline is a target deadline, but we cannot guarantee this until we
          receive the items for inspection. In addition, although at quoting
          stage we assume we can complete the customisation, sometimes factors
          unknown to us at quoting stage can complicate an order and mean we may
          have to cancel and refund. We will always do our best to meet your
          deadlines and complete your orders to our best ability, but in the
          case of print only orders, you understand that the order may be
          cancelled upon receipt of the goods and that the final deadline will
          be confirmed when we physically receive the goods for the specific
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>RETURNS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of finding a fault with the product or printing, simply
          inform us of the problem within 12 hours of delivery by email, or by
          filling out our contact form and we will advise you of the correct way
          of returning the order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the fault and issue with the order, we may request for
          you to ship the order back to us using a trackable service to avoid
          any further issues or we may send a courier to collect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please also supply photos where possible of any issues relating to the
          product or the print so a better idea of the initial problem will be
          more apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that refunds will be considered and discussed after Print
          Wish Ltd has been given every opportunity to rectify any issues with
          the order.
